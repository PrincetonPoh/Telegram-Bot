# Project Neighbourly!
In view of Covid 19, a large chunk of the economy ceased to function. Even simple tasks such as getting food or printing worksheets are tough. In these times, we turn to our friends and family for help. I asked myself why stop there? 

In Singapore, we all live in HDBs where we are mere metres away from multiple households. Despite living so physically close to each other, we are so socially distant. What if we can have a way to find out what each other need? What if we can share our resources with those closest to us in these tough times?

Hence, ***Neighbourly!*** A telegram bot to help people in my neighbourhood share their resources. People use the bot to post requests/offers in the community channel. People then private message (PM) each other to find out more on how they can help each other.



# Plan
1. Learn how telegram API works through the [examples] (https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/tree/master/examples)
2. Host it online using [Heroku] (https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-deploy-a-telegram-bot-using-heroku-for-free-9436f89575d2)
3. Write logic for the actual chatbot
4. Launch first version!
